    "## Overview\n",
    "This project explores player performance in the Premier League using Python, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  \n",
    "The focus is on **position-based trends**, **scoring efficiency**, and **passing performance**, with insights drawn from per-position averages and top performers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project was twofold:\n",
    "1. To practice core data wrangling and visualisation skills in Python.  \n",
    "2. To connect statistical outputs with meaningful football analysis.  \n",

    "## Key Analyses & Visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Performance by Position\n",
    "- **Goals & Assists:** Forwards and attacking midfielders dominate in scoring and chance creation.  \n",
    "- **Passing Accuracy:** Defenders and defensive midfielders show the highest passing completion rates, reflecting their role in recycling possession with shorter, safer passes.  \n",
    "- **Minutes Played:** Goalkeepers and defenders average the most minutes due to tactical stability, while attackers are more frequently rotated due to higher intensity workloads.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Scoring Efficiency (Goals vs xG)\n",
    "- Scatter plot comparing actual goals to expected goals (**xG**) for the top 10 scorers.  \n",
    "- Players above the diagonal line outperformed their xG (efficient finishers), while those below underperformed (less clinical).  \n",
    "- *Insight:* Son Heung-min significantly exceeded his xG, making him one of the most efficient scorers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creativity (Assists vs xA)\n",
    "- Scatter plot comparing actual assists to expected assists (**xA**) for the top 10 assisters.  \n",
    "- Unlike goal scorers, all top 10 assisters outperformed their xA, with Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford standing out.  \n",
    "- *Insight:* Consistent overperformance in xA may highlight vision, creativity, and ability to generate high-value chances beyond what models expect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Analysis\n",
    "- Scatter plot of **pass volume vs pass accuracy** to highlight top 10 passers.  \n",
    "- Defensive midfielders dominate, reflecting their tactical role in maintaining possession and controlling the tempo.  \n",
    "- Rodri and Pierre-Emile HÃ¸jbjerg stood out as elite passers (high volume *and* high accuracy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workload Distribution\n",
    "- Bar chart showing average minutes played by position.  \n",
    "- Goalkeepers, defenders, and defensive midfielders showed the highest workloads with less rotation.  \n",
    "- Attackers and attacking midfielders varied more due to the higher physical intensity of their roles and frequent substitutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack\n",
    "- **Python 3**  \n",
    "- **Pandas** â€” data wrangling  \n",
    "- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€” visualisation  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“š Skills Demonstrated\n",
    "- Data cleaning and feature engineering (e.g., per-90 metrics).  \n",
    "- Grouping and aggregation with Pandas.  \n",
    "- Statistical visualisation with Matplotlib/Seaborn.  \n",
    "- Interpreting data in a sports context (linking stats to tactics/roles).  \n",
    "- Storytelling with data (turning charts into insights).  "
